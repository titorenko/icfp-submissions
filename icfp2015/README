Submission from hi, team

Program comes prebuilt to simplify launching.
Makefile doesn't do much in fact.

Program requires Java8 installed and either located in PATH or pointed by standard JAVA_HOME variable.

To compile it from sources provided in 'sources' directory you need Java8 and maven installed correctly.
https://maven.apache.org/
Sources could be compiled issuing 'mvn clean install' if need be.

Regards
Team :)
