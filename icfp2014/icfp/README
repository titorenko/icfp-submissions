Build project
=============

Project code could be built using maven inside code directory:

mvn install

Prebuilt tools
==============

Code contains directory libs with dependencies and compiled java classes so
that it can be used to generate lambdaman and ghost code out of the box.

Compiling Lambdaman
===================

Intermediate language (see grammar.txt for overview) could be compiled using:

java -classpath submission/code/libs/*:submission/code/src/main/resources lambdaman.SubmissionCompiler /third_bot.gcc

Compiling ghost
===============

GHC assembler files could be compiled using:

java -classpath submission/code/libs/*:submission/code/src/main/resources ghc.GHCLinker /ghost_seek_and_destroy.ghc false

Providing source files
======================

Source files are searched inside classpath and location with files should be added to it e.g.
-classpath submission/code/libs/*:submission/code/src/main/resources
where
submission/code/libs/*             - is all dependencies and compiled code
submission/code/src/main/resources - location of source files
